GETSOCKOPT(2)                                    Linux Programmer's Manual                                   GETSOCKOPT(2)



NAME
       getsockopt, setsockopt - get and set options on sockets

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/types.h>          /* See NOTES */
       #include <sys/socket.hl>

       int getsockopt(int sockfd, int level, int optname, void *optval, socklen_t *optlen);
       int setsockopt(int sockfd, int level, int optname, const void *optval, socklen_t optlen);

DESCRIPTION
       getsockopt() and setsockopt() manipulate options for the socket referred to by the file descriptor sockfd.  Options
       may exist at multiple protocol levels; they are always present at the uppermost socket level.

       When manipulating socket options, the level at which the option resides and the name of the option must  be  speci‐
       fied.   To manipulate options at the sockets API level, level is specified as SOL_SOCKET.  To manipulate options at
       any other level the protocol number of the appropriate protocol controlling the option is supplied.   For  example,
       to  indicate that an option is to be interpreted by the TCP protocol, level should be set to the protocol number of
       TCP; see getprotoent(3).

       The arguments optval and optlen are used to access option values for setsockopt().  For getsockopt() they  identify
       a  buffer  in which the value for the requested option(s) are to be returned.  For getsockopt(), optlen is a value-
       result argument, initially containing the size of the buffer pointed to by optval, and modified on return to  indi‐
       cate the actual size of the value returned.  If no option value is to be supplied or returned, optval may be NULL.

       Optname  and  any specified options are passed uninterpreted to the appropriate protocol module for interpretation.
       The include file <sys/socket.h> contains definitions for socket level options, described below.  Options  at  other
       protocol levels vary in format and name; consult the appropriate entries in section 4 of the manual.

       Most socket-level options utilize an int argument for optval.  For setsockopt(), the argument should be non-zero to
       enable a boolean option, or zero if the option is to be disabled.

       For a description of the available socket options see socket(7) and the appropriate protocol man pages.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EBADF     The argument sockfd is not a valid descriptor.

       EFAULT    The address pointed to by optval is not in a valid part of the process address space.  For  getsockopt(),
                 this error may also be returned if optlen is not in a valid part of the process address space.

       EINVAL    optlen  invalid  in setsockopt().  In some cases this error can also occur for an invalid value in optval
                 (e.g., for the IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP option described in ip(7)).

       ENOPROTOOPT
                 The option is unknown at the level indicated.

       ENOTSOCK  The argument sockfd is a file, not a socket.

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4, 4.4BSD (these system calls first appeared in 4.2BSD), POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       POSIX.1-2001 does not require the inclusion of <sys/types.h>, and this header file is not required on Linux.   How‐
       ever,  some historical (BSD) implementations required this header file, and portable applications are probably wise
       to include it.

       The optlen argument of getsockopt() and setsockopt() is in reality an int [*] (and this is what 4.x BSD  and  libc4
       and libc5 have).  Some POSIX confusion resulted in the present socklen_t, also used by glibc.  See also accept(2).

BUGS
       Several of the socket options should be handled at lower levels of the system.
