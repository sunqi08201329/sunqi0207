FCLOSE(3)                                        Linux Programmer's Manual                                        FCLOSE(3)



NAME
       fclose - close a stream

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>

       int fclose(FILE *fp);

DESCRIPTION
       The  fclose()  function  flushes  the stream pointed to by fp (writing any buffered output data using fflush(3)) and
       closes the underlying file descriptor.

       The behaviour of fclose() is undefined if the stream parameter is an illegal pointer, or  is  a  descriptor  already
       passed to a previous invocation of fclose().

RETURN VALUE
       Upon  successful completion 0 is returned.  Otherwise, EOF is returned and the global variable errno is set to indi‐
       cate the error.  In either case any further access (including another call to fclose()) to  the  stream  results  in
       undefined behavior.

ERRORS
       EBADF  The file descriptor underlying fp is not valid.

       The  fclose()  function  may  also  fail  and  set  errno for any of the errors specified for the routines close(2),
       write(2) or fflush(3).

CONFORMING TO
       C89, C99.

NOTES
       Note that fclose() only flushes the user space buffers provided by the C library.  To ensure that the data is physi‐
       cally stored on disk the kernel buffers must be flushed too, for example, with sync(2) or fsync(2).

SEE ALSO
       close(2), fcloseall(3), fflush(3), fopen(3), setbuf(3)
