echo "\n\t\tMAN PAGE FOR SSAidentify.ksh SHELL SCRIPT\n
This script is used to turn on, or off, the system's SSA disk drive
identification lights.  You can use this script in the following ways:\n
To turn on/off ALL DEFINED SSA drive identification lights, ALL VARIED-ON SSA
drive identification lights (-v switch), AN INDIVIDUAL SSA drive identification
light or A LIST OF SSA drive identification lights.\n
SSA disk drives can be specified by EITHER the pdisk OR the hdisk, or
a COMBINATION OF BOTH.  The script translates all hdisks into the
associated pdisk(s) using the system's /usr/sbin/ssaxlate command and turns
the SSA identification light on/off using the system's /usr/sbin/ssaidentify
command.\n

This script has four switches that control its' action:\n
-? - Displays this man page.\n
on - Turns the SSA identify light(s) ON.\n
off - Turns the SSA identify light(s) OFF.\n
-v - Specifies to only act on SSA disks which are in currently varied-on
volume groups.  The default action is to act on ALL DEFINED SSA disks.\n
NOTE: This switch is ignored for turning on/off individual SSA drive lights,
only valid when turning on/off ALL lights.  This option is very helpful in an
HACMP environment since ALL DEFINED, the default action, will turn on/off all
of the SSA drive lights even if the SSA disk is in a volume group which is not
currently varied-on.  This can be confusing in an HA cluster.\n
Using this script is very straight forward.  The following examples show the
correct use of this script:\n" >> $MAN_FILE
echo "\nUSAGE: SSAidentify.ksh [-v] [on] [off] [pdisk#/hdisk#] [pdisk#/hdisk# list]
\n\nTo Turn ALL Lights Either ON or OFF:
\nUSAGE: SSAidentify.ksh [-v] [on] [off]
\nEXAMPLE: $SCRIPTNAME  on
\nWill turn ON ALL of the system's DEFINED SSA identify lights.
This is the default.
EXAMPLE: SSAidentify.ksh -v  on
\nWill turn ON ALL of the system's currently VARIED ON
SSA identify lights.  OVERRIDES THE DEFAULT ACTION OF ALL DEFINED SSA DISKS
\nTo Turn SPECIFIC LIGHTS Either ON or OFF Using EITHER
the pdisk#(s) AND/OR the hdisk#(s):
\nUSAGE: $SCRIPTNAME [on] [off] pdisk{#1} [hdisk{#2}]...
\nEXAMPLE: $SCRIPTNAME on hdisk36 pdisk44 pdisk47
\nWill turn ON the lights to all of the associated pdisk#(s)
that hdisk36 translates to and PDISKS pdisk44 and pdisk47.
\nNOTE: Can use all pdisks, all hdisks or BOTH hdisk
and pdisk together if you want...\n\n" >> $MAN_FILE
