function rotate
{
# PURPOSE: This function is used to give the end user
# some feedback that "something" is running. It gives
# a line rotating in a circle. This function is started
# as a background process. Assign its PID to a variable
# using
#      rotate &       # To start
#      ROTATE_PID=$!  # Get the PID of the last
#                     # background job
#
#      At the end of execution just break out by
#      killing the $ROTATE_PID process. We also need
#      to do a quick "cleanup" of the leftover line of
#      rotate output.
#
#      FROM THE SCRIPT:
#           kill -9 $ROTATE_PID
#           echo "\b\b "

INTERVAL=1  # Sleep time between rotation intervals
RCOUNT="0"  # For each RCOUNT the line rotates 1/8
            # cycle

while :     # Loop forever...until this function is killed
do
    (( RCOUNT = RCOUNT + 1 )) # Increment the RCOUNT

    case $RCOUNT in
    1) echo .-."\b\c"
       sleep $INTERVAL
       ;;
    2) echo .\\."\b\c"
       sleep $INTERVAL
       ;;
    3) echo "|\b\c"
       sleep $INTERVAL
       ;;
    4) echo "/\b\c"
       sleep $INTERVAL
       ;;
    *) RCOUNT="0" # Reset the RCOUNT to "0", zero.
