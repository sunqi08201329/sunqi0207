# This script demonstrates the use of curly braces to nest addresses
# and commands. Comments are preceded by a pound sign (#) and must
# be on a line by themselves. Commands are terminated with a newline
# or semicolon.  If there is any text after a command, even one
# space, you receive an error message:
#      sed: Extra text at end of command:
