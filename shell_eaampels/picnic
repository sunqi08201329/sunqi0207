I had a lovely time on our little picnic.
Lovers were all around us. It is springtime. Oh
love, how much I adore you. Do you know
the extent of my love? Oh, by the way, I think
I lost my gloves somewhere out in that field of
clover. Did you see them?  I can only hope love
is forever. I live for you. It's hard to get back in the
groove.
